Project Outline:

This game is a heart pounding reflex game where players must nagivate a course while paying close attention to the character at the end of the
course. The objective is to reach to the finish line before the time runs out, but the player must freeze when the character turns to face the 
player to avoid consequences.

Narrative Description:

Spotlight Sprint immerses players in a tense and thrilling experience where every move counts. Players find themseleves in a light up area with 
just his or herself with a person at the end of the area. A timer displays the remaining time to reach to the finish line. The player has only one
mintue to reach to the finish line counting down. As the game progresses, the person turns randomly don't know when the person is going to turn 
making it harder everytime the player gets closer. As the player plays, the red led light will come on and as the player move the green light
is on. This challeging the player reflexs and nerves for this game. 

Components:

Sprites for the players: Visual representation pf the players on the course.

Text display for game over: Displays message when the player fails to reach the finish line.

Timer display: Shows the remaining time for the player to complete the course.

Sound effect: Game over sound effect to let the player know when the game is over and start sound effect let the player know when the

Images of the Ardunio Uno:
Ardunio Uno is an microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P microcontroller chip. This Ardunio is widely used for prototyping and 
creating electrontic projects. This can be created by students professionals or hobbyists. 

As you can see, we have two wires that is connected to the ardunio uno. The blue wire is connected to the red led pin and the white wire is
connected to the green led pin. The red light pin is connected to 12 and the green led light is connected to 13. Defining the pin numbers as 
variables which are 12 and 13, improves the readability, maintainability, ease of modification, and scalability of the code. This makes the 
development and managamenr more smoother and efficient. The led pins also both has reistors to help limit the current through the led lights, to 
prevent them from burning out.

As you can see, red and black wires matter on this part to which is connected to. The red wire will always connect to the positive charge and 
the black wire will connect to the negative charge. The black wire will go to the GND power which is the ground power and the red will go to 
the 5V power which is the 5 volts. This gives the board power to make the things on the board work.

As you can see, we have the button this is where you control the character. The blue wire is connected to the button which is connected to 2 
on the arudino uno. Defining the button numbers as variables which is 2, also helps improves the readability, maintainability, ease of modification, 
and scalability of the code. This makes the development and managamenr more smoother and efficient. Then, it also has a reistors to help the
limit the current. Also, have a red wire that helps the button have power.

As you can see, we have a red and black wire. Red wire is connected to the positive on both side and a black wire connected to negative on 
both side of the board. This gives the board power on both side.

How to play:

To play this game its simple, all you do is press the button to start walking the other person not looking at you and release the button to stop
walking when the other character is looking at you. But make sure you watch the time too because you only have one mintue to reach the finish
line.

Conclusion:

Spotlight Sprint provides an exhilarating gaming experinece that test players reflexes, timing, amd nerves. With the game dynamic gameplay
and enchanting atomsphere, it gives the players a unique challenge for players looking for excitement, adrenaline and a challenge. For the future 
development I want to have other character walking and stopping on their own, so the player wont be the only player in the game. I also want
add intense background music and also having the led lights being control by the other player movement. When the characer turn to face the other
players the led light turn red and when he not facing the player it turns green.



Thank you for playing "Spotlight Sprint"! It was honor to make this game and an honor of having people playing this game.
